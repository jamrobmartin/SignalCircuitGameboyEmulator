# SignalCircuitGameboyEmulator

This project intends to develop a gameboy emualtor, by emulating down to the signal circuit level. For this to work, the input to the emulator is basically a clock that generators high and low signals, and the gameboy "circuitry" should respond automatically. Ideally, the emualtor is entirely comprised of circuits or gates from the [SignalCircuitLib](https://github.com/jamrobmartin/SignalCircuitLib)
